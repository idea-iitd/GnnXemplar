  "dataset_description": "This dataset is inspired by the Minesweeper game. The graph is a regular 100x100 grid where each node (cell) is connected to eight neighboring nodes (with the exception of nodes at the edge of the grid, which have fewer neighbors). 20% of the nodes are randomly selected as mines. The task is to predict which nodes are mines. The node features are one-hot-encoded numbers of neighboring mines. However,for randomly selected 50% of the nodes, the features are unknown, which is indicated by a separate binary feature."
